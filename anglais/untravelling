Suppose you spill lime soda
down the pulsitronic nebuliser of the TARDIS
and it jams the ultrasonic harmoniser.
Or suppose your friend
in a fit of irrational pique
disables the memory on your emotional storage device
so that all the harpsichord songs of history
are overwritten
by ten million copies of Michael Stipe singing ‘Everybody Hurts’.
Or suppose some hypothetical person
were to lose the only key to the heirloom chest
where you keep the flashlight
that shines backward through yesterday
illuminating the corridor of time.
What happens to the past, in that instance?
Is it gummed forever up
by sugar gone rotten?
Is it overwritten?
Spooled away on a string of zeroes and ones?
Or do the oil paintings remain
pinned to walls in the empty hallway,
their pigments glowing red and gold
beneath the dropcloths
amidst the dust
in the dark?
