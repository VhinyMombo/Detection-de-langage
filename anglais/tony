I wrote many poems before I published a single word of fiction, short
or long. Some of the poems I was happy with. Others were terrible.
Thankfully, most of the bad stuff was never published, although a couple
of the more atrocious ones were. I hope they’re being taught somewhere
as examples of bad writing and giving students a laugh. The poems of
mine that I’m most happy with, while not being ‘found’ poems, riff
off the political words of others, hammered into shape with anger, and
sometimes caressed with love. Other institutional words, phrases and
sentences I picked up along the way, interrogating them until they
confessed their hidden meaning. Any dictatorship worth its violent salt
executes the poets first. It is the way it should be, as a great poem cuts
through the crap and goes for the heart and heat like a double-barrelled
shotgun
