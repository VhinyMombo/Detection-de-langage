these two silk birds are frayed and then it touches them.
these two frayed silk birds. into the river diving and emerging.
one such silk is a cracked river stone and this is the surface
of its silk, the green surface of its time in that silk time, its water.
you could cut your foot on that accurate division. if you werenâ€™t
aware. you could lay your hand on it and feel the sharpness
aware in your hand. these silk birds come down from the leaves
of the grey up on the edge of the cliff, they come down
to the water to drink. they fly past the roots that break the cliff
and through the stone cuts water. absolutely slowly and too fast
to see. so holds acceleration in array. when the riverbed bares
its posture and then softens, there go into the memory of water,
into the likely inclination of future water. these forms will
get undone. by their full registration of pressure, heat and sound.
into holding together, into dry and adrift. the dive is whole
into each particle, held or adrift.
