the credits font crumbles to a song
a whole galaxy of concern, one wherein you lack
air. the scenery comes frosted. tell me
your times, specific bare feet on the floorboards:
locate it, see i’ve got you for real here. it’s always
sunset in a vastly specific landscape, sadness
expunged, actors squint-eyed against kissing,
a skirmish of light & dust. in our pillow universe
my robotic arm reveals paddock whorls;
your July 4 stocking run is the sun, wan &
bullocky, softness country’s aura & astrological
guidance. waves trample about, under the radio,
a bristly phalanx. there’s me! through the curtains’
slit with specific flashback: a gaudy analogue colour
saturation – milky additive – & we’re huffing
into a sense of parallelism (naming rights
go missing, ground to some militant pulp).
step into this pre-loaded career & come,
come further past altitude sickness, lost
in the routine of finger-spinning old records,
all things slightly small like me in a room.
my thoughts: everything. mercury dropped
into a bucket atop a median strip. you’d
like that. this was shot generationally
or by degree, a quotient of time, drawn
up by the window with you excluded,
you emended from classification.
it’s systemic while we’re in transit,
all the feels at bay, distance stares
sapped of flavour, winter watermelons.
i’m often on location culling friends. like you,
cold in the maw, middle ground to crystal focus,
light behind, hair pulled specifically back.
