Aftershock and jaw-ache,
a stranger wandering a house in tightening circles.
Hot showers or hotter cups of jasmine cannot fix this.
It sits on my chest and tries
on all of my clothes. Whiskey from wineglasses;
somewhere a whale calf surfaces for air.
I’m tired of writing in this glass box
in the sky. You taught me to slip under the waves like fish
and emerge safe on the side; water flat and calm,
a pane of glass. Come home soon, my love, I’m just
down the hall. There’s nothing in our fridge except milk
and your parents’ quince paste. But flop
onto the navy couch for a Sunday feast.
Can I remind you
one last time the correct ratio
of rice to water?
