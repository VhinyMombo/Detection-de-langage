I stomp through the frostbitten door
and your mouth opens as if to push out
a sentence. The mulled wine
makes our syllables bend
out of grammar.
We try on each other’s skin,
pine, shed eyelashes like bedclothes.
Despite the storm only one snowflake finds its way
into our room.
There is no future tense on your mother’s tongue,
no word for please.
The code we share
is touch.
In a few breakfasts I will jet
south to an island with burning summers
and animals that cannot walk backwards
even if they try. Instead of planning
one last hike inside the forest
we sit by your window, angling to figure out
what the winter sun is
or should do next.
