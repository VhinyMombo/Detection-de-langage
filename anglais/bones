I won’t let it go. The weather-storming-sun hovers out of alignment, there
are fissures and a shadow is cast: what can you say of these stones at my
feet? Precariously. There’s not a word from feathers or thinly shaped bones
brought about by crashing through muddy grounds. By such means, my
head hurts, my feet and eyes sore, and there’s no noise from the birds (other
than me). They say the blackness gets darker as you grow and it is the only
good thing, being borne from this tree that is too small even for this thin
bone. Like toothpicks.

Bone against bone – neither one of us (and still they whisper: bone against
bone). Others are made of leaves and twigs, dark too, but of different
shades: underlays of green and purple, sometimes, in rare places, navy blue,
shimmering. The ground beneath the heaving beast slowly escapes, blends,
resulting in shifts, in flooding water. The shifts can reform when they want,
muddy themselves when they want. There is no quake to warn. Bells tied
to the wrists, branches, wings, wooden staffs. He misses us.

Cast an alloy: more than half the periodic table is here, the process is
entertaining, but the product is useless and costly. It needs to withstand all
temperatures, they say, because temperatures can’t be fixed; but it’s barely
over a hundred and fifty-five degrees and the alloy starts to disintegrate.
Papers are torn into strips, eaten, fed not-roasted; you wouldn’t want to
put out a forest fire, even if the trees are bright and dead and can’t be hurt.
