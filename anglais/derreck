The Only White Landscape is an assembly point. Past instances of thought
and memory have come together as directed when under threat. The
swells of real-life changes underpinning the poetry are physical, social,
geographic and romantic. But, that’s so usual: the attempt to find
singularity in the ruptures – not meaning, not really. From loneliness to
only-ness. Sometimes I run at night through the fields around my house
and then sit on carpet to record the resulting language. ‘I feel so lyrical,’
I remember thinking at one point, mid-manuscript. I’m always seeking
recognition. I want a conversation to surround my personal thoughts. I
want to influence ‘you’ – your actions and opinions. Poetry can and will
measure up to somebody’s sincerity levels but then he / she still might
not love you. All the feels laid bare, the words persisting as evidence
of what you might have thought, felt. The Only White Landscape is a
submersion in the past, a landscape stripped of comforting colour, a
set piece refigured in post like a photograph, my choices of emphasis
directing and deflecting your attention. It feels like an outcome. I hope
the poems keep you just as long as you want to be kept.
