I trace lives along the river; below the Cat-Walk where we hung as sleeping
bats from the rusting beams we left above to fall through summer heat,
readying for the touch of velvet waters dammed sixty feet below. We lifted
the skirts of Skipping Girl, strobing her night vent with an erratic neon, one
lighting the banks infested with years of boosted car wrecks and wet lovers,
until the day came to dress the Girl and order her to perform the peak-hour
crawl, homeward bound to emptiness. The riverâ€™s edge is beautified now,
bridges caged in safety, Deep Rock lies drowned beneath a strip of freeway
and long-abandoned sweat shops dazzle with the cheapness of glass in steel.
Sitting at the falls I skip stones to conjure a memory of you and see us here
on summer nights. Together we carried the river home with us, in our hair
and on our skin.
