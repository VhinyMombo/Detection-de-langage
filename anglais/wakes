Something bubbles from deep within the chest, travels along the air tract
and presses against vocal cords to carefully scratch a way out of its throat. In
that moment the jaw opens and the neck elongates with the desire to move,
to propel itself forward – it keens – only to be dragged down by the weight
of its limbs, or what is left of it, its leaking skin sticks flat to the bones, its
lungs, kidneys and liver. It heaves, lifting one organ at a time, every inch of
the small intestines, followed by the large intestines, nudging and pulling,
learning to use the rhythm between muscle and gravity. All the motions
within range of this body that is falling apart, though, some excreted debris
are held together by cloudy and congealed fluid, they collide unexpectedly.
Joints turn three hundred and sixty degrees and roll through the mud, while
ulnas stretch the oesophagus and diaphragm further apart; bile is pushed out
as the plant crawls along a wet floor as a bleeding vomiting thing. In turn,
its torn stomach sucks back in nutrients from fresh soil, spreads them among
its blood vessels to reconnect the fibres in the wasted muscles, so that it can
keep moving forward, still.
