The rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has broken pandemic records and shuttered borders in several parts of the world, as governments and scientists scramble to understand the implications of the strain before it supersedes Delta and becomes dominant worldwide.

Dr. Anthony Fauci said the United States was "looking over (its) shoulder" at the encroaching variant while battling an ongoing Delta outbreak on Wednesday, as he urged people to get vaccinated and receive booster shots to shore up the American population's protection.
"We are already in a Delta surge. I mean, the cases are going up," Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN. "And then you have, looking over your shoulder, the Omicron variant, which we know from what's going on in South Africa and in the UK, is a highly transmissible virus."
